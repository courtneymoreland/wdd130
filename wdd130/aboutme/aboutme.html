    <p> Hi, </p>
    <p> I am majoring in professional studies with a minor in Biology and a certificate in Computer Science. I was going to major in Biochemistry but I soon realized that everyone in my classes didn't have to work meanwhile, I have been working three jobs and I just couldn't keep up. I currently am employed for the US Army part-time, as a Data Analyst at a finance company in Rigby part time, and as a third party "virtual escort" at Microsoft full-time. When I switched majors, I felt that computer science would give me the greatest advantage in my current field so that's why I am enrolled. </p>
    <p> I have a German Shepherd dog that I love. He is my first born son. I am also expecting the birth of my second born son (human) sometime in July. I really have enjoyed body building in the past, but much less recently. I've been a member of the church for my whole life and love the connections within the Church!  </p>
